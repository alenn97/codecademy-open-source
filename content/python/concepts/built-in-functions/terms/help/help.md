The `help()` function accepts an object as a parameter, which is a module, function, class or keyword. After being called, the documentation of the requested object is displayed.
If no argument is passed the interactive help utility starts up on the console.

## Syntax

The object is passed to the `help()` function as parameter:

```pseudo
help(object)
```

To start the interactive help utility, the function is called without argument:

```pseudo
help()
```

## Example

Below is an example where a build-in function is passed as argument:

```py
help(print)
# Output: 
# print(...)
#    print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
#    
#    Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
#    Optional keyword arguments:
#    file:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
#    sep:   string inserted between values, default a space.
#    end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.
#    flush: whether to forcibly flush the stream.

```

If no argument is present:

```py
help()
# Output:
# Welcome to Python 3's help utility!
# 
# If this is your first time using Python, you should definitely check out
# the tutorial on the internet at https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/.
# 
# Enter the name of any module, keyword, or topic to get help on writing
# Python programs and using Python modules.  To quit this help utility and
# return to the interpreter, just type "quit".
# 
# To get a list of available modules, keywords, symbols, or topics, type
# "modules", "keywords", "symbols", or "topics".  Each module also comes
# with a one-line summary of what it does; to list the modules whose name
# or summary contain a given string such as "spam", type "modules spam".
# 
# help> 
```
